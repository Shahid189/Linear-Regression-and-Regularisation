# Linear-Regression-and-Regularisation
Project of Linear Regression under Professor Ravi Kothari Sir 

Here we used scikit learn package to train Linear Regression, 
Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic net Regression model 
with GridSearchCV to find the best tuning parameter and then compared
and plotted the difference in accuracy with all the model

We used MAE (Mean absolute error), accuracy and even Mean Square error to quantify
and compare results
